* What-Is 

This is a series of ``What Is" articles, which give brief descriptions of
important concepts in numerical analysis and related areas, with a focus on
topics that arise in my research.

My aim is for the articles to adhere to the following criteria.

- The posts are no more than two or three screenfuls (about 500 words).
- The posts contain a minimum of mathematical symbols and equations and a
  minimum of citations.  
- They are accessible to upper level undergraduate students in any
  mathematically oriented subject.
- The list of references given for further reading is very small
  and concentrates on those that are broad, readable, and contain
  further references to the literature.

The articles are available in blog form at
https://nhigham.com/category/what-is/
and are provided in PDF form in this repository.
The PDF files contain hyperlinks, which are clickable in the PDF but 
not visible in a printout.
